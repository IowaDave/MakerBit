# MakerBit

A MakeCode package for Roger Wagner's MakerBit

At January 27, 2018 this package is under development. It can be tested in the standard, online, browser-based editor at  MakeCode.microbit.org by doing the following:

Start a new project.
In JavaScript view, expand the Explorer button and click the "+" sign to add a "custom.ts" module to the Explorer's drop-down list.

Copy the contents of "main.ts" from this github repository over into the "custom.ts" module of the online browser project.

Click on the "main.ts" module in the Explorer drop-down.

Copy the contents of "test.ts" from this github repository over into the "main.ts" module of the online browser project.

Switch the online browser to "Blocks" view. If all goes well, the MakerBit package and its blocks will be available for use.
