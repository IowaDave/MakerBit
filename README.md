# MakerBit

A MakeCode package for Roger Wagner's MakerBit

At January 27, 2018 this package is under development. It can be tested in the standard, online, browser-based editor at  MakeCode.microbit.org by doing the following:

Start a new project.
In JavaScript view, expand the Explorer button and click the "+" sign to add a "custom.ts" module to the Explorer's drop-down list.

Copy the contents of "main.ts" from this github repository over into the "custom.ts" module of the online browser project.

Click on the "main.ts" module in the Explorer drop-down.

Copy the contents of "test.ts" from this github repository over into the "main.ts" module of the online browser project.

Switch the online browser to "Blocks" view. If all goes well, the MakerBit package and its blocks will be available for use.

### Note dated September 2019
To the best of my knowledge this was the first github repostory to provide an extension package designed for Roger Wagner's MakerBit. I demonstrated it to him during a visit to his home in January 2018.

Roger and I agreed that he should seek help from other community members better prepared than I to develop the extension package. Happily, Philipp Henkel was willing to join the effort. Philipp forked this repo and soon produced a really good set of extensions. Thank you Philipp!

I leave this repo existing for historical purposes, only. I do not plan to develop it further.
