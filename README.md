# MakerBit
A package designed for MakeCode with Roger Wagner's MakerBit for micro:bit

We begin on January 15 2018.
The goal of this project is a MakerBit package that can be imported into the MakeCode blocks-programming environment.
Functions in the package to appear as blocks in the MakeCode (pxt) tool.
Intent is to build first using JavaScript.
Not built yet but desired: to refine certain timing-sensitive functions in C++.
